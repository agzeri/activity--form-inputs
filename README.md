# Get first letters

## Steps

1. Paste the below code:

```html
<form name="lettersForm">
  <div>
    <label>First name:</label>
    <input type="text" name="firstName" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <label>Last name:</label>
    <input type="text" name="lastName" />
  </div>
  <input type="submit" value="Show me!">
</form>
```

**Write the necessary JavaScript code to obtain only the first letter from **First name** and **Last name** and convert them into caps.**

**Use an `alert` to display the initials.**

### Examples

+ If I write "Pedro" as First name and "PÃ¡ramo" as last name, I should see an alert with the content "PP".
+ If I write "Lenny" as First name and "Kravitz" as last name, I should see an alert with the content "LK".
+ If I write "Robbie" as First name and "Williams" as last name, I should see an alert with the content "RW".
